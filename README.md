- Hey, i'm just learning stuff. 
- I’m interested in front-end web development, game development, fiddling with stuff to make it work, (or ruin it.) Emulation, how certain malware works and the people behind it, and the security that is used to protect from it.   
- Using HTML and CSS at the moment, still in the process of learning JavaScript.
- No corrent projects.
